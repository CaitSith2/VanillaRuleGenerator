							<h2>On the Subject of Wire Sequences</h2>
							<p class="flavour-text">It's hard to say how this mechanism works. The engineering is pretty impressive, but there must have been an easier way to manage nine wires.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Within this module there are several panels with wires on them, but only one panel is visible at a time. Switch to the next panel by using the down button and the previous panel by using the up button.</li>
								<li>Do not switch to the next panel until you are sure that you have cut all necessary wires on the current panel.</li>
								<li>Cut the wires as directed by the following table. Wire occurrences are cumulative over all panels within the module.</li>
